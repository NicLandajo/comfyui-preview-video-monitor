📰 NEWS📰

🖥️Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.2🖥️ introduces a cleaner, faster, and more precise workflow by removing all JavaScript and autoprompt logic for a fully backend-driven, zero-overhead design, moving workflow_fps to the top of the UI for quicker setup, and upgrading preview_fps into a flexible STRING input that supports both “smart” auto-FPS detection and exact custom framerates like 24, 29.97, or 60. Combined with the existing RAM-cached playback engine, pre-scaled frames, 8-bit optimized surfaces, and smart global caching, v3.2 delivers a smooth, professional, animation-accurate preview experience with simpler controls, greater precision, and the same rock-solid performance as before.

Please note that at the moment this tool is developed and tested over ComfyUI Desktop only, not Portable one. But it should work fine if you want to try it. I will go over testing on Portable soon.
