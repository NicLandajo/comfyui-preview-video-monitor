The Node

#

- Future versions: We´ll work on a more advance, fast and less consuming RAM and GPU engine.
  
  Note: If PVM consumes more resources than you are willing to accept, consider waiting for future updates.
  
- Long term development is a 3D system in the monitor to visualize 3D geometry and gaussian splats

# Vision module

The Vision module transforms your monitor into a technical inspection lab for AI-generated imagery.

Isolate RGB channels to detect hidden artifacts, use the live vectorscope to analyze color distribution,

and stress-test your generations with diagnostic controls that reveal edge cases normal viewing might miss.

Combined with masking capabilities and frame-accurate analysis, Vision gives you forensic-grade tools to

evaluate what the AI actually generated—not just what it appears to show.

# Universal Compatibility

Multi-Format Support - Videos, image sequences, tensors, and all ComfyUI video formats

Flexible Input Sources - Direct files, node outputs, or generated content

Seamless Workflow Integration - Works alongside your existing ComfyUI pipelines

ESC = Exit fullscreen

Shift+q = Close entire monitor interface

ENTER = Toggle generations menu and also once in it triggers change generation name

Cycling the RGB channels: Use "r" "g" and "b" shortcuts to see the red green and blue channels in the monitor

# Important Notes and Storage Control

PreviewVideoMonitor is an advanced video/image viewer with powerful caching and workflow-saving features. However, it is not designed to be your primary file management system.
Key Points:

Always use Save nodes (e.g., Save Image, Save Video, etc.) to permanently store your final work in your regular working directory or custom pipelines.
PreviewVideoMonitor should currently be treated as a volatile preview system — ideal for creative sessions and quick iterations, but not for long-term storage.
PreviewVideoMonitor can save files to disk, its internal session data and cached files are stored inside its own default folder
custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/, but you can change this to your own custom working directory directly from the node, super easy, and giving you full control over where files are kept.
This internal storage may be cleared by users (or accidentally by you) or changed between sessions or updates, so do not rely on it for keeping your work 100% safe.

# Notes PVM and system resources

The cache and display engine it´s still in it´s early design phases and is still not at peak efficiency.
If PVM consumes more resources than you are willing to accept, consider waiting for future versions.

As reference, it´s absolutly not recomended to use a GPU under 12GB VRAM, also take a "rtx nvidia 3060" as the minimum processing power base you would need.
Is also recommended to have a CPU of at least 8 cores horse power.
