🚀 Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 — Faster, Cleaner, and More Precise Than Ever

Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 brings a smoother, more intuitive experience with accurate previews.

✨ What’s New

🎚️ workflow_fps Moved to the Top
Your main timing control is now the first setting you see — making setup quicker and more natural.

🎞️ Improved preview_fps Control now accepts both

"Smart" automatic detection when you want the tool to choose the best framerate, or
Exact custom values like 24, 29.97, 48, or 60 when you need exact animation timing.

⚡ Smoother Playback, Same Rock-Solid Performance

v3.3 builds on the fast, stable playback you already know:

Frames load instantly thanks to optimized caching

Previews feel snappy and lightweight

📁🚂 Preview Video Monitor Pro automatically creates two folders inside /custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/

/cache/: stores temporary optimized video files and pre-scaled frames

/__pycache__/: standard Python bytecode compiled at runtime

Both folders are safe, automatic, and self-maintaining.
