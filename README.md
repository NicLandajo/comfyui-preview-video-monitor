PreviewVideoMonitorPro V5.0 (PVMP) – Important Notes

PVMP is an advanced video/image viewer with powerful caching and workflow-saving features. However, it is not designed to be your primary file management system.
Key Points:

Always use Save nodes (e.g., Save Image, Save Video, etc.) to permanently store your final work in your regular working directory or custom pipelines.
PVMP should currently be treated as a volatile preview system — ideal for creative sessions and quick iterations, but not for long-term storage.
While PVMP can save files to disk, its internal session data and cached files are stored inside its own folder:
custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/
This internal storage may be cleared or changed between sessions or updates, so do not rely on it for keeping your work safe.

Future Improvement
In upcoming versions, you will be able to set a custom storage location for all session-generated data, giving you full control over where files are kept.
Bottom line: Use PVMP as a Monitoring/Viewer system for fast, powerful previews and creative experimentation — but always save your important work properly using dedicated Save nodes.

🚀 Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 — Faster, Cleaner, and More Precise Than Ever

Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 brings a smoother, more intuitive experience with accurate previews.

✨ What’s New

🎚️ workflow_fps Moved to the Top
Your main timing control is now the first setting you see — making setup quicker and more natural.

🎞️ Improved preview_fps Control now accepts both

"Smart" automatic detection when you want the tool to choose the best framerate, or
Exact custom values like 24, 29.97, 48, or 60 when you need exact animation timing.

⚡ Smoother Playback, Same Rock-Solid Performance

v3.3 builds on the fast, stable playback you already know:

Frames load instantly thanks to optimized caching

Previews feel snappy and lightweight

📁🚂 Preview Video Monitor Pro automatically creates two folders inside /custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/

/cache/: stores temporary optimized video files and pre-scaled frames

/__pycache__/: standard Python bytecode compiled at runtime

Both folders are safe, automatic, and self-maintaining.
