Important Notes

PreviewVideoMonitor is an advanced video/image viewer with powerful caching and workflow-saving features. However, it is not designed to be your primary file management system.
Key Points:

Always use Save nodes (e.g., Save Image, Save Video, etc.) to permanently store your final work in your regular working directory or custom pipelines.
PreviewVideoMonitor should currently be treated as a volatile preview system — ideal for creative sessions and quick iterations, but not for long-term storage.
PreviewVideoMonitor can save files to disk, its internal session data and cached files are stored inside its own default folder
custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/, but you can change this to your own custom working directory directly from the node, super easy, and giving you full control over where files are kept.
This internal storage may be cleared by users (or accidentally by you) or changed between sessions or updates, so do not rely on it for keeping your work 100% safe.

🚀 Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 — Faster, Cleaner, and More Precise Than Ever

Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.3 brings a smoother, more intuitive experience with accurate previews.

✨ What’s New

🎚️ workflow_fps Moved to the Top
Your main timing control is now the first setting you see — making setup quicker and more natural.

🎞️ Improved preview_fps Control now accepts both

"Smart" automatic detection when you want the tool to choose the best framerate, or
Exact custom values like 24, 29.97, 48, or 60 when you need exact animation timing.

⚡ Smoother Playback, Same Rock-Solid Performance

v3.3 builds on the fast, stable playback you already know:

Frames load instantly thanks to optimized caching

Previews feel snappy and lightweight

📁🚂 Preview Video Monitor Pro automatically creates two folders inside /custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/

/cache/: stores temporary optimized video files and pre-scaled frames

/__pycache__/: standard Python bytecode compiled at runtime

Both folders are safe, automatic, and self-maintaining.
