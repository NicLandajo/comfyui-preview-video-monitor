🚀 Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.2 — Faster, Cleaner, and More Precise Than Ever

Preview Video Monitor Pro v3.2 brings a smoother, more intuitive experience designed directly for artists, animators, and editors who need reliable, accurate previews every time.

✨ What’s New

🎚️ workflow_fps Moved to the Top
Your main timing control is now the first setting you see — making setup quicker and more natural.

🎞️ Improved preview_fps Control
preview_fps now accepts both:

Smart automatic detection when you want the tool to choose the best framerate, or
Exact custom values like 24, 29.97, 48, or 60 when you need perfect animation timing.

⚡ Smoother Playback, Same Rock-Solid Performance

v3.2 builds on the fast, stable playback you already know:

Frames load instantly thanks to optimized caching

Previews feel snappy and lightweight

Timing accuracy is better than ever


📁🚂 Preview Video Monitor Pro automatically creates two folders inside /custom_nodes/PreviewVideoMonitorPro/

/cache/: stores temporary optimized video files and pre-scaled frames

/__pycache__/: standard Python bytecode compiled at runtime

Both folders are safe, automatic, and self-maintaining.

Please note that at the moment this tool is developed and tested over Windows 10 and ComfyUI Desktop only, not Portable one. But it should work fine if you want to try it. I will go over testing on Portable soon.
