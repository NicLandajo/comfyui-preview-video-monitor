📰 NEWS📰

🖥️ Preview Video Monitor Pro — Version 2.0 (2025-11-12) --- will be out around November 14th/15th

🚀 Major Update — Real-Time RAM-Cached Playback

This update delivers a **massive performance leap** for video playback in ComfyUI, transforming the node into a fully RAM-accelerated, 8-bit optimized video preview system.

---

✨ Highlights

⚡ Full RAM Caching
- Videos are now decoded once and fully cached in memory as 8-bit RGB frames.  
- Playback no longer depends on OpenCV’s disk streaming per frame.  
- Re-runs of the same video reuse cache instantly.

🎨 8-Bit Color Pipeline (was 32-bit Float)
- Replaced float32 frame storage with compact 8-bit RGB surfaces.  
- Cuts memory use by **~75%** and eliminates costly float↔uint8 conversions.  
- No visible quality loss for MP4/H.264 previews.

🧮 Pre-Scaling on Load
- All frames are pre-scaled to the target monitor resolution and fit mode during extraction.  
- Eliminates per-frame OpenCV resize calls during playback.

🧠 Smart Global Cache
- Added a shared global cache keyed by video path + resolution + fit mode.  
- Cached videos persist across prompts until ComfyUI restarts.  
- Automatically bypasses re-decoding for repeated runs.

🧱 Memory-Safe Design
- Built-in memory threshold (default: **2 GiB**) to prevent overload.  
- Large videos gracefully fall back to streaming mode with a log warning.  
- Limit adjustable via environment variable:
  ```bash
  set PREVIEWVM_MAX_CACHE_BYTES=4294967296

Please not that at the moment this tool developed and tested over ComfyUI Desktop only, not Portable one. But it should work the same if you want to try it. I will go over testing on Portable soom.
