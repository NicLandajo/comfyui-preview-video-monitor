Preview Video Monitor Pro is designed to be simple, predictable, and fast.
Here’s a quick guide to understanding each control in the interface and how to use it effectively.

1. workflow_fps (Top of UI)

The fps you´re using on your comfyui workflow logic, so they both match and you can have a smooth playback experience.

2. source

Choose what the node should play:

video input → Plays an MP4 or Video object coming from upstream

images input → Takes IMAGE/IMAGE_BATCH and converts them into a temporary video

3. monitor

Select which physical display will show the preview window.

“Monitor 0” is usually your main screen on the left

Additional screens appear as Monitor 1, 2, 3…

4. power_state

Controls whether the preview window is active:

On → Opens or updates the viewer

Off → Closes the window and pauses playback

Tip:
Turn Off to stop playback without removing the node.

5. fit_mode

Decides how the image fits inside the output resolution:

fit - Keeps aspect ratio, letterboxes if needed

width — Expands to full width

height — Expands to full height

none — Centers image without resizing (actual size)

6. playback_mode

Choose how the video plays:

Forward — Normal playback

Backward — Reverse

Ping-Pong — Forward → reverse → forward…

Pause — Holds on the last frame

7. preview_fps

This controls the playback speed of the preview window.

You can type any value you want, such as:

"24"

"60"

"29.97"

"23.976"

"12"

any float or whole number

You can also type "smart" (default) to let the node automatically match the FPS of the video or image sequence you're previewing.

Tip:
Use "smart" when you don’t know the FPS, or type an exact number when you want to match the known framerate of your source.

8. target_resolution

Sets the final size of the external preview window, this is for you to match your physical GPU and MONITOR/SCREEN settings.

Options:

1920×1080

3840×2160 (4K)

Choose the resolution that matches your display for sharpest results.
