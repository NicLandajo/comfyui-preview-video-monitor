TIP:
Depending on you level of knowledge of your own comfyui local intall and pipeline,
maybe try step 2 first, cause maybe you already meet all the requirements,
so after going over step 2 open comfy and try the node, if all works fine skip step 1,
if not close comfy and go over step 1, then run comfy again.


Step 1. Node Dependencies

----Python Dependencies----

Package	Install Commands

torch	Handles tensor-based video data:	pip install torch

numpy	Frame and video array manipulation:	pip install numpy

pillow	Image handling (PIL):	pip install pillow

opencv-python	Video decoding and frame scaling:	pip install opencv-python

pygame/screeninfo	Display fullscreen video windows:	pip install pygame

-OR-

Run these in your ComfyUI Python environment: pip install torch numpy pillow opencv-python pygame screeninfo


Step 2. Remove old PreviewVideoMonitorPro from your "custom_nodes" folder if exists.

Step 3. Install in custom_nodes

Drop "PreviewVideoMonitorPro" folder in "custom_nodes" comfyui´s folder

THAT´S IT
