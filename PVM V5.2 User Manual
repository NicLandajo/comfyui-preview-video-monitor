Version 5.2 | Professional Video Inspection for ComfyUI

Welcome! 👋
PreviewVideoMonitorPro transforms how you review AI-generated video in ComfyUI.
Whether you're creating videos at home or managing a studio pipeline, this tool gives you frame-accurate playback, technical inspection capabilities, and professional comparison tools—all without leaving your workflow.
This manual is designed for everyone: if you're new, follow the guided walkthrough. If you're a pipeline technical director, check the Advanced Notes at the end for pipeline integration details.

Quick Start: Your First Session
Setting Up the Node

Add the Node
In ComfyUI search PreviewVideoMonitorPro
Connect Your Input
Connect either:

Video source (MP4, image sequence, etc.) to the video input
Image batch to the images input
Image (single) to the images input

Choose Your Monitor
The monitor parameter lets you select which screen displays the viewer (useful for multi-monitor setups)
Power On
Set power_state to ON (true). Turn it Off to switch to another physical monitor and then back to On
Run Your Workflow
Queue your prompt. You´ll see a waiting screen. The monitor window opens automatically on your selected display.

That's it! The monitor loads your generation and you're ready to inspect.

Understanding the Monitor Window
When the monitor opens, you'll see:
The Main Viewing Area
Your video displays here. This is where all the magic happens—playback, inspection, comparison.
The Toolbar (Bottom)
A clean row of controls for everything you need:

Timeline with frame counter
Playback controls (IN/OUT markers, play/pause, frame stepping)
FIT modes (how video scales to screen)
Vision controls (technical inspection)
Generations dropdown (manage multiple runs)
Snapshot (save workflows)
Clear Cache (manage storage)

Design Philosophy: Everything is one click away. No nested menus, no hunting for features.

Chapter 1: Playback & Navigation
Basic Playback
Play/Pause
Click the ►/❚❚ button or press SPACEBAR
The video plays at the speed you set in the FPS control (more on that in a moment).
Frame Stepping

← Left Arrow: Previous frame
→ Right Arrow: Next frame
Hold arrow keys: Smooth 30fps scrubbing through your video

Scrubbing the Timeline
Click and drag anywhere on the timeline bar to jump instantly to any frame. The frame counter updates in real-time.

Setting Your Playback Speed
The FPS Button (grey circle with a dot)
Click it to open the FPS dropup menu:
FPS Presets:
Choose from professional frame rates:

60, 59.94, 50, 48, 30, 29.97, 25, 24, 23.976, 15, 12, 8

Custom FPS (Yellow Box):
Click the yellow-outlined field at the bottom, type your exact frame rate (e.g., 120), press Enter.
First Frame Number (Blue Box):
Any video starts counting at 1, but sometimes you may want to change it to match editing or other departments so that everyone is talking about the "same frame."
Below the FPS field is a blue-outlined field. This sets what number your first frame displays as.
Example: If your video is frame 100-200 of a larger sequence, set this to 100 so the counter shows the correct frame numbers.

Marking IN and OUT Points
Shortcuts: "i" "o" "p"
Sometimes you only want to review a specific section of your video.
Set IN Point:
Navigate to your desired start frame, click the IN button. A red pillar appears on the timeline.
Set OUT Point:
Navigate to your end frame, click the OUT button. Another red pillar appears. The area between them turns yellow.
Playback with Markers:
When markers are set:

Play starts at IN point
Stops at OUT point
Loops back to IN

Pong Mode:
Click Pong to enable ping-pong playback (plays forward, then backward, continuously between IN/OUT)
Toggle Markers Off:
Click IN while already at the IN point to disable markers.

Keyboard Shortcuts (Playback)
(SPACE)   Play/Pause
(←)   Previous frame (hold for scrubbing)
(→)   Next frame (hold for scrubbing)
(HOME)   Jump to first frame
(END)   Jump to last frame

Chapter 2: Viewing Modes
Understanding FIT Modes
Your video's resolution might not match your screen. FIT modes control how the video scales.
The FIT Buttons:
1:1 Fit Width Height Fullscreen Reset
1:1 Mode (Keyboard: 1)
Shows actual pixels—no scaling. Great for pixel-perfect inspection. Press 1 again to toggle back to Fit mode.
Fit Mode (Keyboard: 4)
Scales video to fit screen while preserving aspect ratio. Black bars appear if needed. This is the default.
Width Mode (Keyboard: 2)
Scales video to fill screen width. Height may exceed screen (you'll pan to see it all).
Height Mode (Keyboard: 3)
Scales video to fill screen height. Width may exceed screen.
Fullscreen Mode (Keyboard: 5)
Hides the toolbar, maximizes viewing area. Press 5 again to exit.
Reset Button
Returns to default Fit mode and resets zoom/pan.

Zoom and Pan
Zooming In:
Scroll your mouse wheel UP to zoom in. The video enlarges around your mouse cursor position—point at the detail you want to inspect!
Zooming Out:
Scroll your mouse wheel DOWN to zoom out.
Panning:
Once zoomed, right-click and drag to pan around the video. Zoom can go up to 16x!
Why Use Zoom:
Inspect fine details, check edge artifacts, examine texture quality—essential for technical review.
Return to Fit:
Middle mouse wheel click or Reset button in the main bar

Keyboard numbers Shortcuts (Viewing)
1 Toggle 1:1
2 Width
3 Height
4 Fit
5 Toggle Fullscreen

Mouse Wheel Zoom in/out Right-Click + DragPan (when zoomed)

Chapter 3: The Vision Module 🔬
Vision transforms your monitor into a technical inspection lab. These aren't creative color grading tools—they're diagnostic controls for analyzing what the AI actually generated.
Opening Vision
Click the Vision button (toolbar). A panel slides up with technical controls.
RGB Channel Isolation
The R/G/B Buttons:
Click to isolate individual color channels:

R (Red Channel): See only red information (displayed as grayscale)
G (Green Channel): See only green information
B (Blue Channel): See only blue information
RGB (Full Color): Back to normal view

Use "r" "g" "b" keyboard keys to cycle rgb

Keyboard Shortcut: Press B to toggle Blue channel isolation (useful for quick artifact checks).
Why Use Channel Isolation:
AI generation artifacts often hide in individual channels. Compression issues, color banding, and encoding problems become visible when channels are isolated.

The Vectorscope
What Is It:
A circular display showing color distribution in your video. Each pixel's color is plotted as a dot.
How to Read It:

Center = No color (grayscale)
Edges = Saturated colors
Specific Directions = Specific hues (Red at 0°, Yellow at 60°, Green at 120°, etc.)

The 4×4 Dot Grid:
Our vectorscope uses vibrant 4×4 pixel dots for clear visibility. Watch how the pattern changes as you scrub through frames.
Why Use Vectorscope:
Instantly see if your video has color casts, clipping, or unusual color distributions. Professional colorists use this for quality control.

Diagnostic Sliders
Gain:
Lightens or darkens the image. Drag right to reveal shadow detail, left to check highlight clipping.
Gamma:
Adjusts midtone brightness without affecting pure blacks or whites. Reveals detail in shadows (drag right) or highlights (drag left) while preserving contrast endpoints.
Saturation:
Boosts or reduces color intensity. Crank it up to spot subtle color artifacts.
Why These Aren't Creative Tools:
You're not grading the video—you're testing it. Push brightness to extremes to see if shadow areas hold detail. Max out saturation to reveal color noise.
These controls help you evaluate generation quality, they don´t produce an output at all.

Keyboard Shortcuts (Vision)
 R Toggle Red channel
 G Toggle Green channel
 B Toggle Blue channel

Chapter 4: Comparison Tools
When you generate multiple versions, you need to compare them side-by-side. PreviewVideoMonitorPro gives you two professional comparison modes.
The Generations Dropdown
Click Generations to see all your cached runs. Each generation has:

A timestamp (when it was created)
A prefix (v_ for video, i_ for images)
A comparison button (small square on the right)

Loading a Generation:
Press enter to deploy generations menu or click Generations button in the main bar
Click any generation name to load it into the viewer.
Renaming:
while gen is selected press Enter to rename, then press enter to confirm
Deleting:
Middle mouse wheel click over a gen, confirm. The generation is removed from disk.

Comparison Mode: WIPE 🟡
Activating Wipe:
Click the small square next to any gen to compare to. It turns yellow.
What Happens:
As soon as you click and hold, the yellow wipe interface devider dissapears and you see a clean wipe that you can move side to side.
You can even zoom and pan while on wipe mode.
As soon as you release the left click, the yellow wipe devider interface comes back right where your pointer is. Deactivate wipe with W shortcut.

Wipe Behavior:

Respects your current zoom and pan
Both videos move together
The line stays at your chosen position as you scrub frames

You can take the yellow line from the small square or anywhere else in the line. The line has a capture radius of 12 pixels which makes it comfortable to use.

Deactivating Wipe:
Press W (instant exit) or click the square again.
Keyboard Shortcut: W = Exit comparison modes

Comparison Mode: SIDE-BY-SIDE 🔵
Activating SBS:
Click the yellow square (wipe mode) again. It turns blue.
What Happens:
Screen splits in half with a fixed blue line at center:

LEFT half: Your current video
RIGHT half: Comparison video

SBS Behavior:

Blue line never moves (fixed at screen center)
Each video stays in its own half (clipped at boundaries)
Zoom is synchronized: both videos zoom equally
Zoom anchor: where your mouse is when you scroll
Pan is synchronized: both videos pan together

Why This Matters:
Point your mouse at a point on the left gen, zoom in—both gens at same relative position. You're inspecting the same detail on both generations simultaneously!
Frame-Space Zooming:
Unlike wipe mode (which zooms the whole view), SBS zooms each frame independently within its window. The frames can grow huge (extending beyond their boundaries), but clipping keeps them separated.
Cycling Through Modes:

Grey Square = No comparison
Yellow Square (1st click) = Wipe mode
Blue Square (2nd click) = Side-by-side mode
Grey Square (3rd click) = Back to normal

Keyboard Shortcut: W = Exit any comparison mode wipe and sbs instantly

Chapter 5: Managing Your Work
Generations and RAM
How Generations Work:
Every time you queue your ComfyUI workflow, PreviewVideoMonitorPro:

Decodes your video/images
Caches all frames in RAM (for instant playback)
Saves frames to disk as JPEG sequence (for later reload)
Registers the generation in the dropdown

Why Cache to RAM:
Reading frames from RAM is 100-1000x faster than decoding from disk. This enables:

Instant scrubbing
Smooth playback
Real-time vision slider feedback
Lag-free comparison modes

The Trade-Off:
RAM usage! A 1000-frame 1080p video uses ~6GB RAM. Load 5 generations = 30GB RAM.

Understanding the Cache System (Simple)
Two Caches:

RAM Cache (Fast, Temporary)

Decoded frames in memory
Used for instant playback
Cleared when you close monitor or load different generation


Disk Cache (Slow, Persistent)

JPEG sequences saved in runs_cache folder
Survives closing ComfyUI
Can reload quickly (JPEGs decode fast!)



Normal Workflow:
Generate → Loads to RAM + saves to disk → You review → Close monitor → RAM cleared, disk remains → Open monitor later → Reloads from disk to RAM

The Clear Cache System
Click ClearCache button to open options:
"Clear All Cache" (Current Option)

Deletes all generation folders from disk
Clears RAM
Empties the Generations dropdown
Frees up disk space

Coming in v5.3: Advanced Cache Management
Future versions will offer:

Clear RAM Only (keep files on disk, free memory)
RAM usage display (see how much memory you're using)
Automatic management (smart cleanup when RAM is full)

For Now:
Manage your generations manually—delete old ones you don't need via the Generations dropdown.

Snapshots: Saving Your Workflow
What Is Snapshot:
Captures your current ComfyUI workflow and saves it alongside your generation on a PNG file. Think of it as version control for your prompts and settings.
How It Works:

Enabled by default (snapshot_workflow: true in node)
Automatically saves workflow in temp directory when generation completes
Stored in snapshots folder

Snapshot Button:
Opens a menu to manage saved workflows


--------------------------------------
EXIT the Preview Video Monitor Window:
--------------------------------------
Shift+q
--------------------------------------
Close monitor window and exit the tool. Then you might want to set power_state to Off in the node to completly stop the tool and clear RAM usage.

Naming Convention:
{prefix}_{generations_name}_{timestamp}_{uuid}

Prefix: v_ (video) or i_ (images)
Timestamp: HH-MM-SS (filesystem safe)
UUID: 8-char unique identifier

Metadata System
File: generations_metadata.json
Structure:
json{
  "gen_id_uuid": {
    "folder_path": "path/to/generation",
    "display_name": "v_Generation_14-23-45",
    "timestamp": 1735382625.123,
    "runs_name": "Generation",
    "source_type": "video",
    "total_size": 123456789,
    "frame_count": 1000,
    "format": "jpg"
  }
}
Duplicate Detection
Mechanism:
Before registering a new generation, checks for existing entries with:

Identical total_size (folder size in bytes)
Identical frame_count

Behavior:
If duplicate found:

Deletes newly created folder
Loads existing generation
Logs: "Duplicate content detected"

Edge Case:
If cache is completely empty (len(generations_metadata) == 0), duplicate check is skipped. This ensures re-generation works after full cache clear.
RAM Management (Current Implementation)
Frame Storage:
pythonself.cached_original_frames = [numpy_array, ...]  # All frames
self.cached_comparison_frames = [numpy_array, ...]  # Comparison frames
```

**Memory Calculation:**
```
Per frame: width × height × 3 (RGB) bytes
Example: 1920 × 1080 × 3 = 6,220,800 bytes ≈ 6MB
1000 frames: 6MB × 1000 = 6GB RAM
Caching Strategy (v5.2):
All frames loaded into RAM on generation load. No lazy loading or LRU eviction.
Planned Improvements (v5.3+):

Lazy loading (cache ±50 frames around current position)
LRU eviction (oldest frames dropped when memory limit reached)
Manual RAM clear (free memory without deleting disk files)
Compressed RAM cache (store JPEGs in memory, decode on-the-fly)

GPU Acceleration
OpenCV CUDA Support:
If opencv-contrib-python with CUDA is installed:

Frame resizing uses cv2.cuda.resize()
Significant performance boost for 6K/8K video
Fallback to CPU if CUDA fails

Detection:
pythonCV2_CUDA_AVAILABLE = cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount() > 0
```

**Log Message:**
```
GPU acceleration enabled: cv2_cuda=True, torch_cuda=True
Performance Impact:

1080p: Negligible (PCIe overhead > benefit)
4K: ~10-20% faster
6K/8K: ~50-70% faster

Known Performance Considerations
Zoom Slowdown (v5.2):
At high zoom levels (5x+), rendering slows due to pygame blitting large surfaces (25-100x more pixels).
Root Cause:
python# Current implementation
zoomed_surface = scale(frame, huge_size)  # e.g., 9600×5400
screen.blit(zoomed_surface, position)     # Processes all pixels, even clipped ones
Planned Fix (v5.3):
Crop visible portion BEFORE scaling:
pythonvisible_crop = crop(frame, visible_area)  # Only what's on screen
zoomed = scale(visible_crop, screen_size) # Always ~2M pixels
screen.blit(zoomed, (0, 0))               # Fast regardless of zoom level
Threading Model
Main Thread:
Pygame event loop, rendering, UI
Worker Thread:
Video decoding, frame caching (started on new generation)
Synchronization:

cache_lock: Protects frame cache access
new_content_ready: Event signals cache completion
running flag: Controls thread lifecycle

Extension Points
Custom Vision Filters:
Add to _apply_vision_to_frame() function. Input: RGB numpy array, Output: modified RGB array.
Custom Comparison Modes:
Follow wipe/SBS pattern in _draw_wipe_overlay() and _draw_sbs_overlay().
Custom Metadata:
Extend generations_metadata structure in _register_new_generation().
Environment Variables
Not currently used but could be added for:

PVMP_CACHE_DIR: Override default cache location
PVMP_MAX_RAM_GB: Set RAM limit for auto-cleanup
PVMP_JPEG_QUALITY: Adjust disk cache quality

Troubleshooting
Monitor window doesn't open:

Check power_state is set to ON (true)
Verify all dependencies are installed
Check ComfyUI console for error messages

Performance issues:

Close other applications using RAM
Reduce number of cached generations
For 6K/8K, install opencv-contrib-python with CUDA

Can't see comparison video:

Ensure comparison generation has same frame count
Check that both videos loaded successfully
Try exiting comparison (press W) and re-entering

Keyboard shortcuts not working:

Click the monitor window to give it focus
Check if you're editing text (shortcuts disabled during text entry)


What's Next
Coming in v5.3

Advanced RAM management: Clear RAM without deleting files
Zoom optimization: Smooth performance at any zoom level
RAM usage display: See memory consumption in real-time
Selective cache deletion: Choose which generations to keep

Coming in v5.4+

Lazy loading: Only cache visible frames
LRU eviction: Automatic memory management
Enhanced snapshots: Browse and restore workflows from UI
Export tools: Save frame ranges, create clips
